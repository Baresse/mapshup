    <dch:type>EARTHQUAKE</dch:type>
    <dch:description>At least 52 people have been killed after a 7.4 magnitude tremor hit Guatemala, San Macos region, on Wednesday. Several people have been injured and thousands are left without power. Aftershocks continued into the night causing people to flee their homes and buildings. Many residents camped outside their homes, wrapped in blankets. San Marco has been the most affected where more than 30 buildings were destroyed and 40 deaths were confirmed. Rescue operations are under way; Panama, El Salvador and Honduras have offered to help with the rescue operation. 2000 soldiers have joined the rescue operation teams offering to help find any survivors. This is the most powerful earthquake to hit Guatemala since 1976. President Otto Perez Molina has declared three days of mourning after visiting the affected areas.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Hurricane Sandy - the largest Atlantic tropical storm system on record - made landfall just south of Atlantic City, New Jersey, bringing winds up to 90 mph (150 kph), and pushing a massive storm surge onto beaches and shorelines. At least 50 deaths have been reported. Millions across the Eastern Seaboard are now without power, and even more are struggling with rising floodwater. Sandy continues northward, now downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone, and those affected are now assessing the damage.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Hurricane Sandy tore through the Caribbean between 26-28 October, leaving a reported 51 dead in Haiti and another 15 missing. The country's housing and terrain are particularly vulnerable to flooding, and the refugee camps from the 2010 earthquake have also been affected by the storm. The southern part of Haiti was most affected by the storm, which includes the capital of Port-au-Prince and the 370,000 earthquake refugees in simple wood and tin shelters. More than 200,000 people have been left homeless following the storm, with some coastal houses swept out to sea. In the aftermath of the storm, 17,200 people have been placed in shelters. Though the flood water from the rivers were beginning to recede on Sunday, according to reports, roads have been cut off, bridges have collapsed, and crops have been destroyed, providing further difficulties to Haiti's recovery. There are also concerns that cases of Cholera may increase in the affected areas following the flooding. - View the SERTIT Rapid Mapping webpage for this event</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Heavy rains which started in early August have caused continuing floods in Chad. Hundreds of thousands of people have been affected by the floods, with damage to both property and agriculture. In the Rig Rig District of the Kanem Region, 220 houses were destroyed and 3000 people were displaced. In the Sila Region, more than 13,000 houses were affected and the flood waters blocked major humanitarian supplies. In Guera, an estimated 850 people were in need of emergency support. And floods have also been reported in the capital, N'Djamena. In September the flood waters were still present, and had affected an estimated 466,000 people, and killed 34. 96,000 houses were reported destroyed and 255,000 hectares of crops lost.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>The flood situation in Nigeria, now reported as being at crisis proportions, has also affected Bayelsa State. Virtually all of the communities along the Niger and Benue Rivers have been flooded, and some have been submerged. Bayelsa State is located on the coast of Nigeria, where the rivers empty out into the ocean, and the natural terrain in the area is flat and swamp-land. The flooding in Nigeria has been reported as the worst in 50 years, and though artificial barriers and precautions were in place in Bayelsa State, the flood waters have overwhelmed them. Thousands of people have been left homeless, with both residential and public buildings destroyed.The flood waters have cut off roads to some communities and agriculture has been ravaged by the flood waters, leading to concerns of potential starvation next year. The local population continue to struggle with the situation, displaced from their homes and at risk from disease in some of the worst affected areas. Relief camps have been set up in the Sagbama and Odi communities.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>The flash floods in west Africa, reported to be the worst in 50 years, have also affected Koji State in Nigeria. The state has been declared a national disaster area by the federal government, with two million people displaced by the floods and some communities submerged. The flooding in Koji State has been reported to be at a level not seen in a hundred years and the flood waters have particularly affected Lokoja, the state capital. Lokoja is located at a confluence between the Niger and Benue Rivers, both of which have flooded. Thousands of people have been stranded on the Abuja-Lokoja-Okene Road, a major transportation route that accounts for 70% of the traffic between the north and south of the country. Parts of the highway have been inundated, further impeding transport. Further contributing to the flood waters are excess water released from the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon and the Shiroro and Kainji Dams in Nigeria. Construction firms have been called in to assess the situation and provide solutions.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Floods which began in June have been affecting the Upper Nile state in South Sudan. The flooding in Sudan has displaced over three thousand people, and at least 15 people have been reported killed. The flooding, caused by heavy rain, has cut off roads to rural areas; preventing supplies from reaching them. Of particular concern is the refugee camps in the area, home to over 100,000 people who had fled the internal conflicts in Sudan. The flood waters make their living conditions even more difficult, and also add further risk of disease.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Extreme floods have devastated Northern regions of Cameroon. Nearly 20 people have died and thousands more are left homeless. Continuous rainfall and the release of the Ladgo Dam caused the Benoe River to burst its banks, which flooded neighbouring residential areas. Faro, Mayo Louti, and Benoue areas were most hard-hit by the floods, destroying crop and rice fields thus causing shortages of food supplies. There are growing concerns of infections such as cholera and malaria being spread through flood waters. Rescue operations are under way; more than 2,500 people have been medically treated and placed into tents.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>A Category 1 hurricane hit New Orleans on Tuesday, bringing torrential rain and force-winds to the Gulf Coast. As winds dropped below 75mph, the hurricane downgraded to Tropical Storm Isaac despite expecting another 24 inches of rainfall. The flooding impacted Braithwaite and Louisiana the most where 75 people including their pets were rescued while another 25 still remain on rooftops. The Tropical Storm Isaac killed 23 people in Haiti and the Dominican Republic before heading towards the Gulf Coast. Isaac struck on Tuesday with winds up to 80mph passing through Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. The storm came seven years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, killing nearly 2,000 people. Plaquemines Parish, just 60 miles southwest of New Orleans, collected flood water topping a nine-foot-high flood bank causing 2,000 residents to be evacuated from the area. No deaths or injuries were reported. More than 4,000 U.S. Army National Guard Troops are stationed across New Orleans, working alongside police, fire-fighters and rescue-operations. The troops visited several homes ensuring that there were no deaths or injuries. A dusk-till-dawn curfew has been imposed as the storm continues and will remain in place until further notice. Since the storm, 725,000 people across five states remain without power; leaving some without for a week. U.S. President Barak Obama issued emergency declarations for Louisiana and Mississippi states. Whilst highways, roads and homes remain swamped, search-and-rescue operations will resume in heavily flooded areas.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>On Sunday, 6 people died after torrential rains flooded the Senegalese capital of Dakar. The rains also flooded inner suburbs of the capital. The situation is considered to be catastrophic prompting the Government to trigger the ORSEC plan. The Ministry of the Interior claim that the city?s drainage system failed to cope under the pressure of the gushing water. Senegal?s seaside area is prone for flooding, particularly low-lying suburbs which are built on wetlands. Beyond the capital city of Dakar, other affected locations further from the coast are: Touba, Darou Mousty, Fatick and Kaolack. Thousands have been left homeless and at least 13 lives were lost by 29 August. Exceptional rainfall has been experienced in the region this season. - Download the full reports prepared by UNITAR / UNOSAT for the Flooding in Senegal: Assessment of floods in Dakar province Floods in Touba, Diourbel region, Senegal - Download the full atlas reports prepared by UNITAR / UNOSAT using WorldView-2 imagery: Atlas: Dakar Province, Senegal, 31 August 2012 Atlas: Touba, Diourbel Region, Senegal</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Flash floods killed four people in Russia?s Black Sea region, officials confirmed on Wednesday. On Tuesday evening, torrential rains caused a local river to burst its banks. Since the floods, 1,500 people have been evacuated from the Novomikhailovsky area, 600 houses have been flooded and more than 11,000 people are without electrical power. The rains came only weeks after flash floods in July which killed 171 people in the Russian province of Krasnodar. In the past, the Russian government has been accused of reacting very slowly to disasters; however, President Vladimir Putin has urged emergency services to take necessary measures to assist affected areas. Local residents complained that they not been warned early enough and they could not hear the warning signals through the heavy rain. The federal General?s Office will investigate the handling of the emergency effort. Three officials have been detained for failing to warn local residents in a timely manner.</dch:description>

    <dch:type>EARTHQUAKE</dch:type>
    <dch:description>On Saturday, two strong earthquakes, followed by multiple aftershocks struck north-west Iran. 300 people were killed, more than 3000 victims had been injured and 16,000 people were left homeless. The quakes measured on Richter scales of 6.4 and 6.3, damaging rural villages in Ahar, Varzgahan and Harees, in the city of Tabriz. Some 20 villages in mountainous areas had been completely destroyed whilst hundreds had been damaged. Search and rescue operations came to a close on Sunday since most residents had been accounted for. Officials confirm that residents of affected areas are small and sparsely populated. However, aid and shelter is being provided for the homeless staying in make-shift camps. Iran?s Red Crescent has provided a Sport?s stadium with 6,000 tents, distributing tonnes of food, water and medical supplies to thousands of victims. Hospitals remain overwhelmed, and are struggling to cope with the number of casualties after the quakes. Russian President, Vladimir Putin, has offered to assist Iran during the crisis. Other countries around the world also offered assistance, but Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahamdinejad, refused the offers insisting they could cope with the disaster. The Iranian government have declared two days of mourning in the region.</dch:description>

    <dch:type>FLOOD</dch:type>
    <dch:description>On Tuesday, torrential rains flooded the Philippines capital, Manila. Nine people were found dead buried under a landslide in Quezon City. The rains came after Typhoon Saola struck last week, where more than 50 people had died. Since the typhoon, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council had reported widespread flooding within surrounding provinces of the capital. Tens of thousands of people have been moved into evacuation centres whilst several have fled their homes. Previously the government were not so well prepared when typhoons struck, however this time they have acted very quickly. Rainfall continued for more than 24 hours on Monday, almost 350mm of rain had poured down. In 2009, flash floods caused major dams to overflow and burst river-banks, claiming hundreds of lives. However, this disaster is considered to be worse particularly for affecting mountainous and low-lying areas. The city remains on high alert as officials have forced schools, offices and the Philippine Stock Exchange to close. Authorities, rescue crews and government officials are working together to bring people to safety. The weather bureau confirms that further rainfall is expected over the next few days, but will reduce by the weekend. It is believed the rains were intensified by a tropical storm, ?Haikul? off the east coast of China.</dch:description>

Authorities issued an ?orange? alert, and restricted flights from flying within a 25-mile (40 kilometer) radius of the volcano. The volcano entered the phase of effusive eruption, throwing lava over 1,300 feet high, and ash plumed up to 5,000 meters which continued to fall over the weekend. The National Disasters Agency cautioned nearby villagers to move quickly, however, no evacuations were ordered. This is the largest eruption of the Fuego Volcano in recent times, and is part of activity that began in 2002 including intermittent explosive eruptions and lava flows.</dch:description>

    <dch:type>CYCLONE</dch:type>
    <dch:description>On Monday, the tropical island of Madagascar was hit by Cyclone Giovanna. Since the storm, two people have been killed and in total five deaths have been reported. Offices, schools and businesses have been closed due to power cuts in several areas. Telephone lines have also been cut after the cyclone. The entireity of the damage to the island is not yet known, however, officials warn to expect further danger affecting property and loss of human life. So far, Vatomandry district, where the storm first began, has been badly damaged and mudslides have been reported in the Toamasina-Antananarivo area.  Government officials issued initial warnings to residents of the Cyclone on Monday. However, the intensity or impact of the storm had not been explained very well. The severity of the Cyclone has left many residents in shock. Further rainfall between 10 ? 20 inches is expected to cover the entire Island and there are fears that this could lead to dangerous landslides. A rescue operation is underway in the Vatomandry district; helicopter flights will assess the extent of damage caused. Food and shelter will be provided where it is needed most. - Please see the UNITAR/UNOSAT webpage for a damage review for the city of Brickaville, Vohibinany, Madagascar.</dch:description>

Heavy rains caused the dam to burst in Campos dos Goytacazes, Brazil. Mudslides also struck in the city of Belo Horizonte, killing 6 people due to severe weather conditions. A state of emergency has since been declared in 66 towns and cities in Minas Gerais which are on red alert. Rescue teams and military forces have been moving people to temporary shelters.The Brazilian government has sent civil defence officials to handle the worst affected areas to avoid loss of human lives and reduce material losses. Last year more than 800 people died due to severe flooding in Rio de Janerio, people are being evacuated from several regions to avoid a repeat catastrophe.</dch:description>

    <dch:type>FIRE</dch:type>
    <dch:description>On Thursday, a massive forest fire raged through the Torres del Paine National Park in Patagonia, Chile. The fire had been caused by high fanned winds and dry vegetation which started on Tuesday, spreading wide across the area. Four hundred tourists had to be evacuated from the national park as fire fighters tried to control the fire. Officials confirmed that more than 85 sq km (21,000 acres) of land had been destroyed in the event. President Sebastian Pinera requested urgent assistance from Argentina, Australia and the United States after declaring the region a disaster area. Hundreds of military personnel and fire fighters were deployed at the scene to fight the blaze. Chilean authorities conducted an investigation and believe that the blaze started due to careless visitors at the park.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Typhoon Washi hit Iligan City, Philippines, on 16 December 2011. The typhoon triggered flash floods and landslides which killed more than 650 people and left 800 persons missing. Government and Army officials confirmed on Saturday that 100,000 homes had been fled after winds gusted up to 90km/h (56mph), leaving several areas without power and caused domestic flights to be grounded. Since the disaster took place, US and China has offered aid and assistance, many survivors need water, shelter and medicine. Extensive damage to roads has disabled rescue efforts to reach survivors trapped in remote villages. The Philippines is hit by several storms and typhoons per year and the authorities have been criticised for not acting quickly enough to warn civilians of the severity of the storm.</dch:description>

    <dch:type>OIL_SPILL</dch:type>
    <dch:description>An oil spill resulted on Wednesday 05 October, the cargo ship MV Rena ran aground on the Astrolabe Reef off the port of Tauranga, New Zealand. Maritime New Zealand estimates 350 tonnes of oil leaked from the Rena, and it is believed the ship had 1,900 tonnes of oil and diesel on-board. Despite an International salvage response to refloat the vessel the situation has worsened over the past few days due to the adverse weather conditions. The Rena has suffered substantial structure failure, with cracks appearing in the hull. This has been caused by the movement of the vessel as the stern, which has remained afloat, shifting with the waves, while the front part of the ship remains stuck on the reef. Urgent aerial surveillance is required. Current weather conditions are hampering such operations. Suitable EOS applications are now required to assist in the detection of pollution. The owners of the ship are making every effort to minimise any further damages to the environment.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Colombia's president Juan Manuel Santos has declared a state of emergency across most of the country, amid what he says is the worst rainy season in 60 years. More than 130 people have been killed as floods have brought havoc in 28 out of Colombia?s 32 provinces. Well over a million people have been affected by overflowing rivers and mudslides. Thousands of people have been given relief supplies. Houses have been flooded, some completely submerged, and many people are homeless. The country's second annual rainy season began in September with particular intensity, as the weather phenomenon La Nina brought lower temperatures in central and eastern parts of South America. The government says the state lacks funds for the relief effort and needs nearly 240 million euros. Last weekend the president launched an appeal for international aid.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Floodwater caused by heavy rains in Namibia's northern and north-eastern regions has brought an out-break of cholera, and is also being blamed for a lower than expected cereal harvest for 2008. The Namibian government declared a state of emergency on 5 March, while the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) said in its situation report on 13 March that conditions in the affected regions were "worsening": 72 cases of suspected cholera have been reported, of which 4 were confirmed and one was fatal. "The increased floodwaters have submerged pit latrines and overflowed the sewerage system. We are anticipating an increase in cholera cases and other waterborne diseases," UNICEF said. A report by the Namibia Early Warning and Food Information System (NEWFIS), released on 10 March, noted that "heavy and constant rains received between mid-January and early February 2008, especially in the North Central and Caprivi regions, have resulted in water logging and leaching, and leads to poor germinations and stunted growth (of crops)."</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Severe fires swept through many areas of Greece during the summer of 2007, burning 2700 km2 of forest and farmland and causing 87 deaths. In response to the request from the Department of Emergency Planning and Response of the Greek Civil Protection concerning the severe fire events that affected their territory since 21 August, the European Space Agency (ESA) has taken the responsibility of the Charter Project Management, and, in collaboration with the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (the French Space Agency, CNES), have organised a team of value adding organisations to deliver crisis mapping products. This group is based on Greek, French and German partners; for instance, the Institute for Space Applications and Remote Sensing of the National Observatory of Athens, under contract to ESA within the RISK-EOS GMES Service Element project; SERTIT, with support from CNES; the German DLR ZKI organisation, another partner of RISK-EOS. A series of EO based crisis/damage mapping products have been generated using a variety of Earth Observation sensors, such as, in the early phase of activation, Medium Resolution Optical data from ENVISAT MERIS, DMC (incl. Nigeriasat-1), Landsat, SAC-C, SPOT and FORMOSAT.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>The floods which have hit Romania have taken their toll: more than 172,000 hectares of land and more than 30 areas have been affected. The worst hit have been Timis, Arad, Caras-Severin and Braila. In the areas of Buzua and Prahova, many places have also suffered from lanslides. Four people have been reported dead and one missing and 3400 people have been evcuated in the last few months. The rains have devastated areas in more than 400 towns and 28 areas. More than 5300 houses, 8000 outhouses and tens of thousands of hectares of land have been destroyed. The Prime Minister, Calin Popescu Tariceanu, made a statement this week saying that they will be considering solutions for the reconstruction of the 1000 houses in Timis and Caras-Severin which were totally destroyed by the floods. The next stage will be to put this bid out to tender to companies who will undertake the recontruction work. It has also been promised that the new houses will be finished before the start of the winter months. A dam broke on 16 April, causing severe flooding along the Danube in the area of Bistret and Rast.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Flooding in Germany Flooding in Austria Flooding in Hungary Flooding in Romania PRAGUE, 31 March, 2006 (AFP) - Large swathes of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and the German region of Saxony remained on flood alert Friday as the death toll from swollen rivers rose and more people were evacuated from their homes. In Romania, a child was carried away by a raging river in the region of Suceava, in the north of the country, and his grandfather almost perished in the torrent trying to save him, local authorities said on Friday. A 13 year old junior canoeing champion was still missing, two days after his boat capsized during a violent storm, police in the western town of Deva said. At least four people, including two children, have already perished in the floods and two were misssing in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The River Elbe on both sides of the Czech-German border continued to be the main focus for concern as the river rose to critical levels late on Friday. Local authorities in Dresden, Germany, warned they might be forced to evacuate 1,000 people from their homes in Saxony's main city on Saturday after the river rose above the seven-meter (23-foot) mark, more than three times its normal level. Upstream, at Bad-Schandau, around 150 people were forced to leave their homes on Friday. In the Czech Republic, a further 120 people were evacuated in the city of Usti Nad Labem, in addition to about 300 people who were cleared from their homes near the river embankment on Thursday and 150 who had to leave their homes around 20 kilometres upstream near Litomerice. The situation was stable in the two worst-hit Czech regions -- south Moravia and south Bohemia. Around 2,000 people already had been evacuated from the south Moravian town of Znojmo and its surroundings on Wednesday and Thursday. But the Czech hydrometeorological office late on Friday extended its nationwide flood warning to Monday evening as rain began to fall across the country. More showers and storms are predicted for the weekend together with a warmer spell which could thaw the remaining snow and further swell rivers. In Slovakia firemen warned that levels of the Morava and Danube rivers will have to be monitored closely. The Slovak interior ministry said Friday that 140 towns and villages, in addition to 1,300 hectares, have been affected thus far, and that river levels were still rising in the east. Around 400 people -- 350 in Brodske, on the banks of the Morava -- have been evacuated thus far. Czech Prime Minister Jiri Paroubek cut short a visit to Egypt and sought to reassure his countrymen, scarred by the catastrophic floods of 2002 and 1997. "At the moment there is no call for serious concern," he said after a special Cabinet meeting Thursday night. In Prague, a level-two flood alert remained in place Friday in spite of a slow rise in the level of the Vltava which had already overflowed some embankments. Level-three is the highest level alert. The Romanian Ministry of Environment announced a flood alert in 19 of the country's 41 administrative regions with heavy rainfall predicted over the next days. Dozens of hectares of agricultural land are already under water with strong winds damaging roofs and power lines across the country.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>An earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale killed four people and wounded more than sixty others in the area of Laalam, in the North-East of Algeria. It struck on Monday evening in the Laalam area, the locality of Laalam - in the North-East of Algeria - leaving four dead and 67 wounded according to a provisional report. According to the Algerian Center in astronomy, astrophysics and geophysics (ARCAA), the magnitude was 5.8 on the Richter scale and the earthquake took place at 20h44 local time. Its epicentre was located closeto the town of Kherrata, located between Bjaia and Stif, 300 km to the east of Algiers. About thirty houses collapsed and civilians and military dispatched provided help at the scene and continued to do so throughout the night. The people killed are three children of 5, 9 and 13 years and a 26 year old adult. Several aftershocks followed the first quake, forcing inhabitants to spend the night outside. The Director of the Health Service in Bjaia - 60km from Laalam - declared in the evening that nobody had been badly injured and and that they had suffered only from fractures or emotional shock. "They have all been given the best of care", he added. Algeria ia often affected by earthquakes as the north of the country is located in a seismic area where the Eurasian and African plates conjoin. Algiers and the surrouding area was hit on May 21, 2003, by a violent seism that left 2300 dead and more than 10 000 wounded.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>MANILA - A huge landslide on the Island of Leyte on the west point of the Islands of the Philippines has caused at least two hundred deaths and 1,500 people are missing, according to the Red Cross. The local authorities have only officially announced a total of 23 dead. Some 500 houses and a primary school have been buried under the the mud which, after two weeks of continious rain, came from a mountainous escarpment.. "It was as if the mountain had exploded and that it had completely collapsed.", said Dario Libatan, one of the survivors, to Radio Manille DZMM. "There is not a house left standing". Rosette Lerias, the governor of Leyte Province, said to the Radio DZBB that it was feared that 500 houses and a primary school full of pupils were buried in Ginsahugan, a village which has approximately 2.500 inhabitant. "The ground was soaked with water because of the rains", said Lerias. At the last count, 53 people have been rescued. Senator Richard Gordon, the Dircector of the Red Cross in the Philippines, said that it seems as if the whole village had been buried by the Island of Leyte, causing 200 deaths and 1.500 missing. "This is our estimate as there has been no official body count", he said in a telephone call to the Associated Press from Geneva. "We are organising the rescue operation. This region is rather unfortunately famous for landslides.". Two other villages have also been affected and about 3000 people have been evcauted to a state building. According to the Ambassador of the United States, the American Army are sending a ship which will bring aid. In November 1991, almost 6000 people were found dead on the Island of Leyte as a result of floods and landslides caused by a tropical storm.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>Water supplies to more than 100,000 people in the Comoros islands (Indian Ocean) have been contaminated by the eruption of one of the world's largest active volcanoes. Mount Karthala sent clouds of ash and sparks flying, leaving the capital Moroni and other villages on the main island of Grande Comore covered in grey. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported concerns regarding the availability of potable water in the areas exposed to smoke and ashes as well as about the impact of pollution from volcanic debris on agriculture and livestock. Approximately 2,000 people fled their villages in the region of Bambao in the central part of the island, and have sought refuge in less exposed areas.</dch:description>

The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, who released these figures on 03 May 2005, fears that these may be an underestimate, due to the numbers of people that are still being reported missing ten days after the flooding began caused by the rising levels of the Wabe Shebelle River. UNO has also reported that there are difficulties reaching the affected areas. The floods started after two days of torrential rains which started on 23 April 2005. The affected areas are located 700 km east of the capital, Addis Abeba. Land, homes, wells and roads have also been seriously damaged.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>The Charter was activated following a train explosion which occurred Thursday, 23 April 2004 at 12:10 local time. The initial report of Agence France Press follows. "At least 150 died and 1,000 people were injured in the railroad catastrophe in North Korea, which was caused by an explosion of dynamite, said an official of an Irish non-governmental organisation based in Pyongyang. The North Korean authorities "told us that 150 people were killed by the explosion, including schoolchildren, and that buildings collapsed, that 800 houses were destroyed and 1,000 people injured", said Ann O'Mahony, regional director of "Concern", a non-governmental organisation. The Red Cross estimated initially that 54 people died and 1,249 people were injured. The accidental detonation of a load of explosives is at the origin of the catastrophe which took place Thursday in a North Korean railway station, said North Korean sources. Workers separating two wagons loaded with dynamite in order to hook them to another train accidentally hit electric wires overhead, causing the explosion, said Mrs O'Mahony, quoting North Korean authorities. While preliminary information from South Korean medias initially attributed the accident to the collision of two trains loaded with fuel oil, a United Nations official, quoting the North Korean government, indicated to Agence France Presse that it was not a collision but "the detonation of two wagons loaded with explosives, dynamite probably, when they hit electrical wires after changing tracks." According to latest reports, a zone 800 meters in radius was levelled by the explosion. The death toll had reached 161 by Sunday 25th April, according to North Korean authorities. North Korea has officially called for international assistance (sources: OOSA, Associated Press).</dch:description>

The Prestige tanker started leaking fuel off the coast of Galicia, Spain, on Thursday November 14, 2002 when it encountered a violent storm about 150 miles off Spain's Atlantic coast. During several days, it was pulled far from the shore, but the crippled tanker carrying more than 67,000 tons of oil split in half off the northwest coast of Spain on Tuesday (Nov. 19), threatening one of the worst environmental disasters in history. The rear section of the Prestige sunk early in the day, taking many of the oil tanks with it. The leak already had spilled at least 7,000 tons of oil.</dch:description>

    <dch:description>On Friday, September 20, an avalanche occurred on a mountainside in North Ossetia, a region affected earlier in June by floods. The avalanche was caused by a 150-meter-tall chunk of glacier that broke off and slid down the mountain. Moving at around 150 kilometers an hour, the avalanche slid 33 kilometers and stopped 10 kilometers from the town of Vladikavkaz. The path of destruction was nearly 300 meters to 400 meters wide. The avalanche buried the village of Karmadon and adjacent holidaying areas under a 50-kilometer layer of stones and ice. As of September 27, according to EMERCOM, 12 people had been found dead, 27 people had been rescued, and 99 people were still missing. Preliminary reports estimate the material damage caused by the disaster to be between 15 and 17 million US dollars.

    <dch:description>On December 31, 2001, the Charter was activated in order to evaluate the extent of the flooding of the Moselle and Meuse rivers, located in the northeast of France. The satellite images showed the location of the frozen areas into the retention basin of the Meuse river (S-SE of Sedan), which could have triggered another flood event if the air temperature had increased. Maps produced from these images were a valuable tool for on-field works during the crisis period. The satellites of the Charter constellation were able to provide a daily coverage for seven days. This permitted to follow the actual evolution of the flood on maps delivered a few hours after acquisition everyday.</dch:description>
